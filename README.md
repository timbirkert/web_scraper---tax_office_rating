## 🎬 How It Works

### 1. The scraper:
- [Navigates to the index page](https://github.com/timbirkert/web_scraper---tax_office_rating/blob/main/code/main.py) with all tax offices  
- Follows each link to the subpage of a tax office  
- [Extracts relevant data](https://github.com/timbirkert/web_scraper---tax_office_rating/blob/main/code/finanzamtseite_infos2.py) using BeautifulSoup and stores it in structured form

### 2. The data:
- Is [stored in an Excel file](https://github.com/timbirkert/web_scraper---tax_office_rating/blob/main/code/liste_in%20_excel.py) with one row per office  
- Columns: `Name`, `Address`, `Rating`, `Website`, `Communities`, etc.
